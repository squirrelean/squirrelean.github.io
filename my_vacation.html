                On June 1st, 2025, I boarded my flight heading to Naples at the Montreal-Pierre Elliot Trudeau airport alongside my mother and sister. 
                I would arrive at the Naples International Airport on June 2nd around noon, where I would then make my way down to San Giuseppe, 
                grabbing some fresh pizza along the way to our appartement. Every day spent in Naples was a memoriable adventure. One of our more 
                notable advanetures was our visit to the ancient ruins of Pompeii. After spending a total of five days in Naples, we took a ferry
                to the island of Sardinia, where we would remain for the majority of our vacation.
