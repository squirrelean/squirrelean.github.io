                    Welcome to my page, visitor! I am a second semester computer science student interested in low-level and systems 
                    software engineering.

                <h3>Seeds of Sound</h3>
                <p>
                    Near the end of my first semester, I was brought to the attention of the Seeds of Sound art project, which required 
                    hardware from old phones to be repurposed to play specific audio through the phones speaker when picked up. This
                    project would require redesigning the phones internal layout, modifying PCB traces, working with microcontrollers, 
                    and soldering, which is why the schools art departement came to us for help. Over the next couple of months, all five of us 
                    would get together in the CS study room whenever we had free time to work on this project. During our work sessions,
                    we faced issues like: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Oversized push buttons &amp microcontroller boards</li>
                        <li>Phone chassis size limitations</li>
                        <li>Damaged hardware in the old phones</li>
                    </ul>
                    but were able to overcome these challenges through careful planning, engineering, ingenuity, and some pizza. Shortly after the 
                    start of the following semester, we found out that the project we worked so tirelessly on will be featured in the flagship 
                    <strong>United Nations World Food Forum</strong> event on October 10, 2025.
